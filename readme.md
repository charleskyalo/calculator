## How am going to aproach it Approach it

- Create a wrapper with a width with a width of 400px to set up the calculator.



Suggested approach:
-  Create a wrapper with a width of 400px to set up the calculator.

-  Determine how many rows and columns we need.

- Identify elements that occupy more than one column.

-  Determine the HTML tags required to code rows and cells.

- Code a single row of 4 elements to start with and see if you can get that working.

- Now add the other rows of 4 elements.

-  Finally, add the rows where there are fewer than 4 elements. What do you need to adjust to get these to work?

- Once your layout is mostly working, add the colors and make it pretty.
